This plugin will replace the file shredder in redact with my version. I don't claim that this is more secure in any way, just a goofy little plugin. Also, I broke the progress, so there will be no indication of progress until it is fully finished. Note: the plugin has to be placed in the plugins folder. The shredder dll has to be placed in the same location as the redact executable. A log file will be generated.
